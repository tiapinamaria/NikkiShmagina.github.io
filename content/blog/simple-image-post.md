---

This Joint Degree between HEC Paris and Ecole Polytechnique will equip students with both the technical skills and the strategic mindset to lead successfully any business career requiring a strong expertise in Big Data. The key aim of the teaching in this Joint Degree is to provide students with the tools needed to solve real problems, using structured and unstructured data masses, teaching them to ask the ‘right’ questions (both from statistics and ‘business’ perspectives) and to use the appropriate mathematical and IT tools to answer these questions. Students will be equipped to shift constantly from data to knowledge, from knowledge to strategic decision, and from strategic decision to operational business implementations. All these shifts carry with them numerous challenges that each require an interdisciplinary approach involving mathematics, IT, business strategy, and management skills.
